  color: #fff;
  background-color: #728308;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  text-align: center;
}

header h1 {
  border: 0.8rem solid white;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.6rem 1.2rem;
  border-radius: 3.6rem;
}
```

import header_img from "./img/header.png";

<details>
  <summary>Header</summary>
  <img src={header_img} alt="document header" />
</details>

## Banner

```html
<section class="banner">
  <img src="./img/ben10_banner.jpg" alt="welcome banner" />
  <div class="welcome">
    <h2>Welcome to <br /><span>Ben10 Club</span></h2>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css
/* Banner Image */
.banner img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

## Navigation Links

```html
<!--Navigation Links-->
<nav class="main-nav">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" class="join">Join the club</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Latest news</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">New movies</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>

nav {
  background: #f4f4f4;
  padding: 2rem;
}

nav ul {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

## CSS Position

The next objectives are:

1. Make our header fixed to the top
2. Move the the welcome text into the banner image
3. Make the navigation links stick to the top when you scroll past it

To do that, we need to learn about CSS Position which is a property that lets us change the layout of the page by defining the position of elements on the webpage. The [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) lesson is perfect with the examples given.

Here's a summary of each position property:

**Static**: By default, elements are positioned statically, meaning they follow the normal document flow and ignore any top, right, bottom, left, or z-index values.

**Relative**: The element's position remains part of the document flow, similar to static positioning. However, the top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties now work to shift it slightly from its original location.

**Absolute**: The element is removed from the document flow, and other elements will behave as if it's not there. All positioning properties (top, right, bottom, left, z-index) apply directly to it.

**Fixed**: Like absolute positioning, a fixed element is also removed from the flow, but it always stays in a fixed spot relative to the viewport, unaffected by scrolling. It doesn't respond to parent elements for positioning.

**Sticky**: This element behaves as relative until the user scrolls to a certain point in the viewport, where it becomes fixed. This allows it to “stick” to a specific position once that scroll threshold is reached.

**Inherit**: This setting makes an element take on its parent's positioning value, allowing positioning properties to cascade from the parent element.

## Project Continuation

```css
header {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #728308;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  text-align: center;
  /*  fixed positioning  */
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

- `position: fixed;`: The element is removed from the flow of the document and becomes fixed.
- `top: 0;`: This positions the element to the top of the page
- `width: 100%;`: Even though the element is a block element, by changing it to a fixed element, it takes up just the width of its content like a `display: inline;`. `width: 100%` forces it to take up the entire width of the page.

### Banner section

```css {2-4,8,12-27}
/* SECTION - BANNER */
.banner {
  position: relative;
}
/* Banner Image */
.banner img {
  /* To cover the entire section */
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}

.banner .welcome {
  font-size: 6rem;
  padding: 3rem;
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 30%;
  color: white;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  border-radius: 10px;
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}

.banner .welcome span {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}
```

- `.banner { position: relative; }`: The `.banner` section is positioned relatively, which means it will stay within the normal document flow but serves as a reference point for any absolutely positioned elements inside it.
- `.banner img { display: block; }`: Sets the image to block display mode, making it behave as a block element without extra spacing around it.
- `width: 100%;`: Stretches the image to cover the full width of the `.banner` section.
- `position: absolute; left: 0; top: 30%;`: Positions the `.welcome` element absolutely within the `.banner`, starting 30% from the top and 0% from the left edge.
- `background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);`: Creates a semi-transparent background using RGBA for better readability over the banner image.
- `backdrop-filter: blur(10px);`: Adds a 10px blur effect behind the background, creating a frosted glass appearance.
