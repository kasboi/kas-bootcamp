There are 2 main approaches towards responsive design, mobile first or desktop first.

If you choose a mobile first approach, you begin the development and layout with mobile screens in mind and then work your way up with tablet, desktop and other large screen devices.

Desktop approach begins with developing for large screens first and then working your way down by modifying your layout at different smaller breakpoints.

Our Ben10 project has been using a desktop approach so far. What we would do now is pick some breakpoints and ensure that our layout is perfect for those range of breakpoints.

## Project Continuation

The breakpoints I have chosen are: `1024px`, `768px`, `600px` and `480px`. There would be gaps in the project for screen sizes that are not properly covered, so I implore you to go further than these limited breakpoints when we are done to ensure your project is fully responsive and accessible.

## `max-width: 1024px`

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .banner .welcome {
    font-size: 4.5rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    top: 35%;
  }

  section.images {
    padding: 3rem 0;
    background-image: url("./img/ben10_background_m7zx9p_c_scale\,w_1212.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: scroll;
  }

  section.images img {
    width: 28rem;
  }
}
```

### Breakdown

- `@media screen and (max-width: 1024px)`- Media query definition that targets screen sizes from `1024px` and below.
- `.banner .welcome` - The font-size and paddings are reduced to fit the text content properly on the screen, the `top` property is also increased to bring the positioned element further down.
- `section.images` - responsive images are implemented in our css too!,the [responsivebreakpoint](https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/) tool is used to generate various background images for our breakpoints. This gives an added benefit of reduced file size. When the user visits our website from a device with a screen size of 1024 or lower, a smaller image is downloaded and used as the background image in the images section.
  - `background-repeat: no-repeat` disables background image being repeated.
  - `background-attachment: scroll` ensures the image scrolls with the rest of the section.
- `section.images img` - The width of the images are reduced to fit all three on a row. This might not be an ideal technique, but we would get into proper ways of doing responsive images with css layouts (grid & flexbox) later on.

## `max-width: 768px`

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  nav ul {
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 3rem;
  }

  nav ul li {
    flex-basis: 45%;
  }

  section.images {
    background-image: url("./img/ben10_background_m7zx9p_c_scale\,w_843.png");
  }

  section.images img {
    width: 20rem;
  }
}
```

### Breakdown

- `@media screen and (max-width: 768px)` - Targets screen sizes of `768px` and below. The styles defined here will override any conflicting one defined in the `1024px` query because of css cacade. Therefore, writing your media queries in a proper order is important.
- `.nav ul` - This element uses flexbox for layout
  - `flex-wrap: wrap;` - A flexbox property that allows the child elements to break to the next line/row if there's not enough space on the initial row.
  - `gap: 3rem;` - Adds gap to the row and columns between the elements
- `nav ul li { flex-basis: 45%; }` - A flexbox property for defining the space taken by each of the child elements in the flexbox container.
- `section.images {  background-image: url("./img/ben10_background_m7zx9p_c_scale\,w_843.png"); }` - A smaller image for this range of devices, reduces bandwith used.
- `section.images img { width: 20rem; }` - Reduces the width of the images to fit on a row.

## `max-width: 600px`

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .banner .welcome {
    position: static;
    color: initial;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1rem;
    background-color: #f4fce3;
  }
  section.images img {
    width: 16rem;
  }
}
```

### Breakdown

- `.banner .welcome` - Here, we restore the element to its default position, colour and reduced the font-size
  - `position: static` - This resets the element from position absolute to its default position (static)
  - `color: initial;` - The [initial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial) value resets any property to its default value. Yes, we could have used it to reset the element position.

## `max-width: 480px`

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  header {
    position: static;
  }

  nav {
    position: static;
  }

  nav ul li {
    flex-basis: 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }

  article h2 {
    font-size: 3.5rem;
  }

  article p {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
  }

  section.images img {
    width: 10rem;
  }

  section.newsletter {
    padding: 4rem 2rem;
  }
  section.newsletter p {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
  }
}
```

### Breakdown

- `header { position: static }` - Resets element position, therefore disabling fixed positioning
- `nav { position: static }` - Resets element position, therefore disabling sticky positioning
- `nav ul li { flex-basis: 100%; text-align: center; }` - each element takes up the entire width of a row.
- `article h2` & `article p` - Reduced font-size to make content look better.
- `section.images img { width: 10rem; }` - Reduced the width of the images to fit on a single row.
- ` section.newsletter` - Reduced top and bottom paddings to give content enough space.
- `section.newsletter p` - Reduced font-size to make content look better.

## Project Hosting

I believe this project is good enough to show off as a reward of your hardwork, and it's hard to that with everyone you know from your own pc. To put your website on the internet, you need a web hosting platform to store all your files and generate a URL which you can share. There are two main free(-ish) hostiing platforms i prefer, [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

For this project, I would be using Netlify.

import netlify_dashboard from "./img/netlify_dashboard.png";
import netlify_drag from "./img/netlify_drag_drop.png";
import netlify_deploys from "./img/netlify_deploy_settings.png";
import netlify_url from "./img/netlify_url_dashboard.png";

## Netlify

There are 2 ways to publish your web app on Netlify. Setting up with your GitHub repository or uploading manually. This guide would be focusing on uploading manually

### Steps

1. Create an account with Netlify - [sign up page](https://app.netlify.com/signup) using:
   1. An existing GitHub account
   2. E-mail & password
2. Verify your account via link sent to e-mail
3. Log in with your credentials
4. You should get redirected to your dashboard

   <img src={netlify_dashboard} alt="netlify platform dashboard" />

5. Click on Add new site → Deploy manually
6. You get redirected to the drop page.

   <img src={netlify_drag} alt="netlify drag and drop" />

7. Drag and drop your website folder there or click on `browse to upload` and pick the folder. Ensure you pick the correct folder containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript(if necessary) files.
   **NOTE**: The main or landing page must be named `index.html` so that Netlify knows where to point to.
8. Wait for it completely upload, do not refresh while doing so
9. You should get redirected to a page that looks like this

   <img src={netlify_deploys} alt="netlify deploys page" />

10. Click on site overview on the sidebar and you should see the generated URL that points to website live online
    <img src={netlify_url} alt="netlify generated url dashboard" />
