## CSS Reset

One of the first things you might want to do is reset the default margins and paddings on the elements

```css
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: "border-box";
}
```

1. The `*` selector is called a universal selector which selects every element on the webpage. It has a specificity of zero (0) meaning any selector can override it.

2. We set the padding and margin of every to 0, this includes headings (h1, h2, ..., h6), paragraphs and lists.

### `box-sizing`

To better understand this property, we need to take a look at the box model. This [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) lesson explains this perfectly.

TLDR: When you specify the height and width of an element, this only covers the content area. The total width and height will include the `border-width` and `padding`

import box_model from "./img/box-model.jpg";

<details>
  <summary>Box model</summary>

{" "}

<h3>Box model</h3>
<img src={box_model} width={480} alt="favicon path" />

{" "}

<p>
  The total width in the element above = (300 + 40 + 40 + 20 + 20)px = 420px
</p>
<p>
  The total height in the element above = (250 + 40 + 40 + 20 + 20)px = 370px
</p>

</details>

We can change this behavior using the `box-sizing` property. The default value is `content-box`, but we can use the `border-box` value to ensure that the padding and border-width are incorporated into the width and height of the element.

```html
<style>
  .div1 {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  .div2 {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 1px solid red;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h2>With box-sizing</h2>

  <div class="div1">Both divs are the same size now!</div>
  <br />
  <div class="div2">Hooray!</div>
</body>
```

import HtmlOutput from "@site/src/components/HtmlOutput";

<details>
  <summary>`border-box`</summary>
  <HtmlOutput>
    <h2>border-box</h2>

    <div style={{
      width: "300px",
      height: "100px",
      border: "2px solid blue",
      boxSizing: "border-box"
    }}>Both divs are the same size now!</div>
    <br />
    <div style={{
      width: "300px",
      height: "100px",
      border: "2px solid red",
      padding: "50px",
      boxSizing: "border-box"
    }}>Hooray!</div>

  </HtmlOutput>
</details>

The code below shows what it would have looked like by default

```html
<style>
  .div1 {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    /* This can be ommitted since it's the default */
    box-sizing: content-box;
  }

  .div2 {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 1px solid red;
    /* This can be ommitted since it's the default */
    box-sizing: content-box;
  }
</style>
```

<details>
  <summary>`content-box`</summary>
  <HtmlOutput>
    <h2>content-box</h2>

    <div style={{
      width: "300px",
      height: "100px",
      border: "2px solid blue",
      boxSizing: "content-box"
    }}>300px width, 1px border-width and zero padding</div>
    <br />
    <div style={{
      width: "300px",
      height: "100px",
      border: "2px solid red",
      padding: "50px",
      boxSizing: "content-box"
    }}>Same width and border-width but the padding inflates the total width and height</div>

  </HtmlOutput>
</details>

## fonts

Next, we need to properly set the fonts on the webpage

```css
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
}

body {
  font-size: 1.6rem;
}
```

The first thing to know is that fonts are inherited from the parent element, so whenever we define a font on the `html` tag, it's inherited by the `body` tag and the `paragraph` elements inherit it from the `body` and so on.

### `html { font-size: 62.5% }`

Here, we set the font-size of the html document to a relative unit i.e. percentage (%). The default font size is 16px for most browsers, so when we set the font-size to 62.5% it becomes `0.625 * 16 = 10px`.

### `body { font-size: 1.6rem }`

`rem` is also a relative unit which is based on the font-size of the root element (`html`). when the html font-size is 10px:

- `1rem = 1 x 10px = 10px`
- `1.5rem = 1.5 x 10px = 15px`

:::note[% vs px]
You might be wondering why we used `62.5%` as the root font size and not just explicitly use `10px`. The reason is mostly based on accessibility. In most browsers, the default font size is `16px` but some users might change this to something bigger like `18px` or `20px`, so if we override this with `10px`, we will be forcing a smaller font on them. but when we use relative fonts `62.5%` will be `10px` on normal browsers but `11.25px` for browsers set to `18px` or `12.5px` for browsers set to `20px`.

### Fonts Summary

I know this topic can be confusing and that's normal. You can keep coming back to this lesson anytime to refresh or read up on the references attached.

- `font-family` is inherited i.e. The font (Inter) applied to the `html` selector is inherited by the `body` element and all of its children.

- Most elements have a default `font-size` which is based on the root element i.e. html. The default for most browsers is 16px but the user might change it.
  - Example: If the root font-size is 16px, h1 is `2em = 2 x 16 = 32px`. Consult this [lesson](/docs/css-basics/css-102#default-font-sizes) to see the rest.
