# Newsletter, input pseudo-classes & footer

Up next is the newsletter section where we collect visitors email.

```html
<section class="newsletter">
  <h2>Join Today!</h2>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Accusamus, commodi
    eos facere harum iure mollitia! Beatae eveniet incidunt provident qui.
  </p>
  <form>
    <input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      id="email"
      placeholder="Enter email & hit enter"
    />
  </form>
</section>
```

**CSS**

```css
section.newsletter {
  background: #f4f4f4;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 60px 20px;
  color: #4b4b4b;
}

section.newsletter h2 {
  font-size: 3.4rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
}

section.newsletter p {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
}
```

## form `input`

```css
form input {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  padding: 1.2rem 2rem;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  border-radius: 2.8rem;
  border: 4px solid #ced4da;
}
```

When we focus on the input, you notice it has a black ring around it. This is an [outline](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_outline.asp), which is a line drawn around elements outside the border. To disable it:

```css
form input {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  padding: 1.2rem 2rem;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  border-radius: 2.8rem;
  border: 4px solid #ced4da;
  outline: none;
}
```

## Form state â€” `:focus`, `:valid` & `:invalid`

Just like anchor tags have dedicated pseudo-classes such as `:link` and `:visited`, form inputs also have theirs. In this section, we would apply some styling to let the user know the state of their input i.e valid or not

```css
form input:valid {
  background-color: #f4fce3;
  border: 4px solid #a9e34b;
}

form input:invalid {
  background-color: #fff5f5;
  border: 4px solid #ff8787;
}
```

This flags the input automatically as valid but also indicates when the input is invalid as the user types.

I do not agree with this behaviour, what i want is for the input to be in a neutral state when the page loads or out of focus. The validity styling should only appear on focus.

```css
form input:focus:valid {
  background-color: #f4fce3;
  border: 4px solid #a9e34b;
}

form input:focus:invalid {
  background-color: #fff5f5;
  border: 4px solid #ff8787;
}
```

If you prefer though, you can leave the input `:invalid` as it was i.e. always display the invalid styling when there's an error regardless of focus.

One last thing, the browser declares the input as valid immediately we focus on this input. we want to avoid this by applying the required attribute to the input.

```html
<input
  type="email"
  name="email"
  id="email"
  placeholder="Enter email & hit enter"
  minlength="6"
  required
/>
```

Took it a step further by ensuring the minimum length of the input is six (6).

### Optional

You can even take this verification further by only validating after the user starts typing

```css
form input:focus:invalid:not(:placeholder-shown) {
  background-color: #fff5f5;
  border: 4px solid #ff8787;
}
```

With this, the validation starts after the first keyword is inputted.

- `:placeholder-shown` - This is a pseudo-class that is activated when the placeholder holder is showing
- `:not()` - This is a pseudo-class for inverting a state. it can be combined with many other pseudo-classes
- `:not(:placeholder-shown)` - This translates to "This selector is activated when the place holder is not shown"
- `:focus:invalid:not(:placeholder-shown)` - Selector that is activated when the input has focus, invalid and the placeholder is not showing.

## Footer

```html
<footer>
  <p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2024 Ben10 Club</p>
</footer>
```

The only new thing here is `&copy;`, which is called a HTML character enitity. Charater entities allow us to use symbols and other characters which are reserved in HTML such as `>` and `<`.
