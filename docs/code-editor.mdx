# VS Code setup

## Code Editors:

Code editors are essential tools for writing, modifying, and debugging code in various programming languages. They provide a simple interface for developers to write code, often equipped with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection to improve efficiency. Popular code editors include lightweight options like Sublime Text and Notepad++, as well as more feature-rich environments like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) 

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

VSCode, developed by Microsoft, is one of the most widely used code editors due to its versatility and extensive range of features. It supports a broad array of programming languages right out of the box and can be extended with thousands of extensions available in its marketplace.
