## What do web developers do?

I believe that before deciding on taking this programme, there will have been a spark of curiosity and maybe little research on what web development is.

In essence, a web developer builds and maintain websites. Web developers usually work with clients looking to get their products and services on to the web. The client here could be a tech company (Meta, Amazon), an organisation(Jumia, Konga), or a government (NCDC, NHIS).

Web development could be a good profession for you if you like solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies because I can assure you, there's always something interesting popping up from new frameworks and libraries to accessibility rules.

## Types of Web developers

1. Front end: This is what you see when you go on any website, be it a SM app like Facebook or twitter, e-commerce website like Jumia or Amazon or school portal. It involves the presentation of content including things like navigation bar, news feed, buttons, animations. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS and Javascript and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.
2. Back end: This is involves the things that happen on the server, such as managing communications between two users on a SM app or serving a post to your news feed, keeping track of products and payment management. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to work with data.
3. Full-stack: They are comfortable working with both the front and back ends.
