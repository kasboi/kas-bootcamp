## Headings

We begin the project by introducing headings which are mostly used for titles. We have 6 variants of headings `h1-h6` in HTML with decreasing font-size

```html
<h1>Heading 1...</h1>
<h2>Heading 2...</h2>
<h3>Heading 3...</h3>
<h4>Heading 4...</h4>
<h5>Heading 5...</h5>
<h6>Heading 6...</h6>
```

### Output

<details>
  <summary>Toggle me!</summary>

<HTMLOutput>
    <h1>Heading 1...</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2...</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3...</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4...</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5...</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6...</h6>
</HTMLOutput>

</details>

Now, lets use this tag in our project

```html title="/html_basics/index.html" showLineNumbers {6,9-10}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>About Me - HTML Blog</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Paragraphs

HTML `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph and it starts on a new line

## Line break

Used where breaks in lines are critical: Poem, address, etc.

```html
<p>
    Line of poem<br />
    Another line of the poem
</p>
```

```html title="/html_basics/index.html" showLineNumbers {11-19}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>About Me - HTML Blog</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Erron Black, a passionate web developer. I love creating
            websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

        <p>
            I've been coding for over 5 years, and I've worked with a variety of
            languages, but my favorite by far is HTML because it is the
            foundation of the web.
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Quotations

`<blockquote>` defines a quote from an external source

```html title="/html_basics/index.html" showLineNumbers {20-23}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>About Me - HTML Blog</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay
        </blockquote>
    </body>
</html>
```

We have other forms of quotes such as `cite`, `address`, `abbr`, `q`. Read about them here: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quotation_elements.asp)

## SEO and Accessibility

If you actually go through some of those quotation tags, you'll notice that some of them do not have visual output such as the `abbr` tag. You might be wondering what purpose it then serves

To answer this, we need to understand that there are people who visit websites in different ways such as visually impaired people who use screen readers to access the pages. There's a need to make the pages accessible to them by properly tagging the texts so that screen reader devices can inform the user about what's on the page and its purpose

Also, if you want the page to rank higher on search engine results, you need to properly apply tags so that the page comes up in appropriate search queries.

export const HTMLOutput = ({ children }) => {
    return (
        <div
            style={{
                padding: "10px 5px",
                borderRadius: "6px",
                border: "2px solid #dee2e6",
                backgroundColor: "white",
                color: "black",
            }}
        >
            {children}
        </div>
    )
}

export const Blockquote = ({ children }) => {
    return <blockquote style={{ color: "black" }}>{children}</blockquote>
}
