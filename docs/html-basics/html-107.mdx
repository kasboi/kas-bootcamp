## HTML Semantic elements

HTML is used to defined the content and structure of a webpage. It is important for us as developers to structure our website in a machine-readable manner i.e. in a manner that the meanings can be properly inferred.

`form` is an exmaple of a semantic element because it is obvious that it should contain form inputs. Another example which we've covered is the `table` element.

Examples of non-semantic elements are `div` and `span`. Merely looking at it, it's hard to infer the purpose of the tags.

```html
<div>
  <span>Three words</span>
  <div>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <div>five words</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>three words</div>
    <div>forty-six words</div>
    <div>forty-four words</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>seven words</div>
    <div>sixty-eight words</div>
    <div>forty-four words</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <span>five words</span>
</div>
```

Just looking at the code, it's hard to discern what most of the code blocks represent. A semantic approach is applied below:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Three words</h1>
  <nav>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <header>
    <h1>five words</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>three words</h2>
    <p>forty-six words</p>
    <p>forty-four words</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>seven words</h2>
    <p>sixty-eight words</p>
    <p>forty-four words</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>five words</p>
</footer>
```

The benefits of using semantic elements include better accessiblity, SEO ranking and ensuring that the browser renders the content properly.

### Common semantic elements

Going forward, we will be seeing more of the following semantic elements:

- `section`
- `header`
- `nav`
- `footer`
- `main`
- `article`

By their names, you can probably infer their purpose.

In terms of visual output, most of these elements behave like `div` but they help communicate purpose to the browser and web-crawlers.

There are over 50 semantic elements and you can read more about them via the References
