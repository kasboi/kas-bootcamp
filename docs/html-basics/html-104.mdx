## ID and Classes

`id` and `class` are HTML attributes used to identify elements. They are mostly used to pick an element for styling or perform JavaScript operations

### `id`

From the last class, we covered anchor tags and how we can use them to navigate from one page to another. Here, we will take a look at how to navigate between elements on the same page.

To do this, you need to give the element you want to navigate to a unique `id` attribute. We use `id` to uniquely identify elements and it is strongly recommended to never repeat an `id`

```html
<!-- HTML Element -->
<element id="some-id">HTML Element</element>

<!-- Anchor tag to navigate to the element -->
<a href="#some-id">Take me to the element</a>
```

    Hi, I'm Erron Black, a passionate web developer. I love creating websites
    that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

    I've been coding for over 5 years, and I've worked with a variety of
    languages, but my favorite by far is HTML because it is the foundation of
    the web.

### `class`

We use classes to identify multiple one or multiple elements. Unlike `id`, we can apply a single class to multiple elements. We will delve more into this when we start styling our elements

```html
<div class="container">
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div with the "container" class.</p>
</div>
```

## Divs and Span

`div` (division): A block-level element used to group or section off larger chunks of content, such as paragraphs, images, or other block elements. It typically creates a line break before and after it, occupying the full width available by default.

### Div example

```html
<div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">
  <h1>This is a Heading inside a div</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
```

<details>
  <summary>Toggle me!</summary>
  <HtmlOutput>
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: "lightblue", padding: "10px" }}>
      <h1>This is a Heading inside a div</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
    </div>
  </HtmlOutput>
</details>

`span`: An inline element used to wrap small portions of text or inline content within a larger element, such as within a paragraph. It doesnâ€™t cause a line break and only takes up as much width as its content.

### Span example

```html
<p>
  This is a normal paragraph with
  <span style="color: red;">some red text</span> inside it.
</p>
```

<details>
  <summary>Toggle me!</summary>
  <HtmlOutput>
    <p>
      This is a normal paragraph with{" "}
      <span style={{ color: "red" }}>some red text</span> inside it.
    </p>
  </HtmlOutput>
</details>
