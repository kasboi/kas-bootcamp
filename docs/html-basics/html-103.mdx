## Lists

We have 3 types of lists in HTML, ordered, unordered and description lists.

### Unordered List

When defining a list, the first tag you use specifies the type of list you want to declare and within it you type the list items. Unordered list tag is represented by `<ul>` and list items by `<li>`

```html showLineNumbers {17-21}
<body>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Erron Black, a passionate web developer. I love creating
        websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been coding for over 5 years, and I've worked with a variety of
        languages, but my favorite by far is HTML because it is the foundation
        of the web.
    </p>
    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <blockquote>
        "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay
    </blockquote>
    <h2>My Articles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How to Create a Signup Form</li>
        <li>Simple Recipe Page</li>
        <li>State and capital in Nigeria</li>
        <li>Travel Destinations</li>
    </ul>
</body>
```

## Comments

Comments are used to write some information that are ignored by the browser.

```html showLineNumbers {2,15,19}
<body>
    <!-- This is an example of a comment -->
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>

        websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>

        languages, but my favorite by far is HTML because it is the foundation
        of the web.

    </blockquote>
    <!-- My blog articles -->
    <h2>My Articles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How to Create a Signup Form</li>
        <li>Simple Recipe Page</li>
        <li>State and capital in Nigeria</li>
        <li>Travel Destinations</li>
    </ul>
</body>
```

### Use case:

-   You encounter a bug and unsure of which part of your code might be causing it, so you might comment out some part of it and check if everything works fine, repeat this process as needed.
-   Comments are used to provide documentation about what a piece of code does for yourself and others who might read or inherit your codebase.

You will find the concept of comments in every programming language you write later on

## Links

Here comes the hypertext part of the HTML. Links are used to connect pages to each other, like when you go to a corporate website and they have multiple pages such as `contact`, `about us`, `terms of use` etc. All these pages would be connected to each other through links.

We use an anchor tag `<a>` for links. The anchor tag makes use of an attribute `href` which is necessary to dictate the location you want to take the user.

```html
<!-- Relative URL -->
<!-- This takes the user to http://yourwbesite.com/about.html -->
<a href="about.html">About us</a>

<!-- Absolute URL -->
<a href="https://instagram.com">About us</a>
```

### `target` attribute

The default behaviour of the anchor tag is to open the link in the current window. To change this behaviour, you can use the target attribute

```html
<!-- Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab: -->
<a href="https://instagram.com" target="_blank">Meta - instagram</a>

<!-- The default: opens the link in the same window -->
<a href="/contact.html" target="_self">Contact us</a>
```

### Project Continuation

```html showLineNumbers
<body>
    <!-- This is an example of a comment -->
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://google.com">This entire text will take you to the Google homepage</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This <a href="https://wikipedia.com">link</a> takes you to wikipedia.

    </HtmlOutput>

</details>

:::note
The default colour of links is a shade of blue but your links might appear purple which indicates visited. This is usually because the link has been visited before especially for popular ones like Google.

## Images

The `img` tag is used to display images/grahical content on the webpage. It requires the `src` (source) attribute to determine the location of the intended image. An optional but recommended attribute called `alt` is also available in case the image cannot be rendered and also for screen readers.

First create a new folder `img` to keep the images

```
[html_basics]
│
├── index.html
└── [img]
```

```html
<h2>Random pictures of dogs</h2>
<img src="./img/cute_dog.jpg" />
<img src="./img/doggo.jpg" />
```
import dog1 from "./img/cute_dog.jpg"
import dog2 from "./img/doggo.jpg"

<details>
    <summary>Toggle me!</summary>
    <HtmlOutput>
        <h2>Random pictures of dogs</h2>
        <img src={dog1} alt="Image of a puppy"/>
        <img src={dog2} alt="Image of two puppies" />
    </HtmlOutput>
</details>
