Learning to code and build things was one of the best decisions I have ever made but to be very honest, while learning to code is very rewarding but it can also be very difficult and frustrating. It becomes easier but like every other skill worth knowing, it takes time to acquire, and it can't be learned in a weekend or even a month. It's a continuous process of improvement

## Motivation

We all have various reasons for learning and picking this path, maybe it:

1. Plans to have a fulfilling career that pays well
2. Excitement about the creative outlet programming provides
3. Determination to build any website or app you can dream of
4. Plans to start your own company or turning an idea to reality

Whatever it is, kindly hold on to this motivation as it will be the one thing pulling you through to the end of the programme, giving you a clear goal to aim towards.

## Growth Mindset

I would also like to discuss mindsets because when learning programming or just about any other skills, this determines how far you can go and impact on your success.

There are people with **fixed mindset**, who believe that if they don't get something right on their first try/attempt, they never will. They just give up and believe they are not smart enough to be able to do or understand some things.

But the thing is, research has shown in various studies that intelligence isn't fixed but something that can be developed. Interesting right? which brings us to the next type of mindset. Someone with a **growth mindset** believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence.

So, what am i getting at exactly? It means you can learn anything and develop new talents and skills with persistence and grit.

There will be many times throughout programme that you will get stuck on a concept or a programming problem and may find yourself questioning your ability to learn programming. When you find yourself in this position, remind yourself that you may not get it yet but that with persistence and grit you will. Struggling with something is growth. It doesn't matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through. That's how real learning happens.

## How to get the best from this programme

1. Take notes and ask questions in class or dedicated channels (WhatsApp, Google Classroom, Slack)
2. Attempt your exercises on your own before seeking external assistance
2. Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!
